I am a Lecturer with the School of Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering at Nanjing University of Posts. Previously, I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in June 2025 and the B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Dalian University of Technology (DLUT) in June 2020. My research interests include FPGA Accelerator Design, Advanced Cryptographic Hardware Acceleration, Post-Quantum Cryptographic Hardware Acceleration, and AI Hardware Acceleration. I serve as an Executive Committee Member of the CCF Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing. I also serve as an independent reviewer for several academic journals, including IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems (TVLSI, CCF-B), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB, CCF-B), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers (TCAS-I, Q2), International Journal of Electronics (SCIE), Microprocessors and Microsystems (SCIE), and IET Computers & Digital Techniques (EI).
